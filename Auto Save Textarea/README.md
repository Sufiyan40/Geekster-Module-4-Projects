# Auto-Save Text Area

This project is a simple web application that features an auto-saving text area. The content typed into the text area is automatically saved in the browser's local storage, allowing the user to retain their input even after refreshing the page or closing and reopening the browser.

## Features

- **Auto-Save Functionality**: Automatically saves the content in the text area as the user types.
- **Persistent Storage**: Content is stored in the browser's `localStorage` and is reloaded when the page is refreshed or reopened.
- **Responsive Design**: The text area is styled to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the text area and overall layout.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for auto-saving the content and loading it from `localStorage`.
